## Installation
The `logger` plugin comes with the Signalize default installation. You just need to import it.

- After the plugin setup, logger will automatically start sending requests to the configured endpoint.
- The default level that is send is `error` only.
- You can change it by passing `levels` during the initialization.

```js
import Signalize from 'signalizejs';
import loggerPlugin from 'signalizejs/width';

new Signalize({
	plugins: [
		loggerPlugin({
			url: 'https://example.com/api/log-client-error',
			// Optional
			levels: ['log', 'warning', 'error']
		})
	]
});
```
