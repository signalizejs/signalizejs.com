Signalize core starts mutation observer automatically for each instance and watches the configured root for `childList` and `subtree` changes.

## Installation
The `mutation-observer` module is in the Signalize core.

```js
import Signalize from 'signalizejs';

const { observeMutations } = new Signalize();
```

## API

### observeMutations
Observe mutations and provide callback and options
- [initOptions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver/observe#parameters) are identical to mutation observer options
- `callback`: function that receives a list of mutations based on configuration

```js
import Signalize from 'signalizejs';

const { observeMutations } = new Signalize();

const element = document.querySelector('#element');

// Observe mutation for element, dispatch event to configured Signalize root.
const observer = observeMutations(element);

// Observe mutation for element, do not dispatch event, call callback instead.
const observer = observeMutations(element, (mutations) => {
	// Do something, when there is a mutation on selected element
});
```

## Dispatched events
Events are dispatched to root only if no callback is provided

- `dom:mutation` - This event is fired on every dom mutation
- `dom:mutation:node:added` - This event is fired when any node is added
- `dom:mutation:node:moved` - This event is fired when any node was moved in the dom
- `dom:mutation:node:removed` - This event is fired when any node is removed
