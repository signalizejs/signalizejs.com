The redraw method provided by Snippets plugin can be used to manually redraw snippets in the actual DOM. It can redraw multiple snippets at once.

## Installation
The `snippets` plugin comes with the Signalize default installation. You just need to import it.

```js
import Signalize from 'signalizejs';
import snippetsPlugin from 'signalizejs/snippets';

const { redrawSnippet } = new Signalize({
	plugins: [ snippeetsPlugin() ]
});
```

## API

### redrawSnippet
Redraw snippets in the current DOM on string input

<Editor code={`
<div snippet="snippet-1">Hello ...</div>
<div snippet="snippet-2"></div>

<button id="button">Redraw</button>

<script type="module">
	import Signalize from '${cdnUrl()}';
	import snippets from '${cdnUrl('snippets')}';
	const { on, redrawSnippet } = new Signalize({ plugins: [ snippets() ]});

	on('click', '#button', () => {
		// Redraw snippets based on HTML input
		redrawSnippet(\`
			<div snippet="snippet-1">Hello World!</div>
			<div snippet="snippet-2">Clicked</div>
		\`)
	});
</script>
`} />

The default snippet action is replace. But you can also append/prepend children. This is good for carousels and products list.

<Editor code={`

<ul snippet="list" snippet-action="append-children">
	<li>Item</li>
</ul>

<button id="button">Redraw</button>

<script type="module">
	import Signalize from '${cdnUrl()}';
	import snippets from '${cdnUrl('snippets')}';
	const { on, redrawSnippet } = new Signalize({ plugins: [ snippets() ]});

	on('click', '#button', () => {
		// Redraw snippets based on HTML input
		redrawSnippet(\`
			<ul snippet="list" snippet-action="append-children">
				<li>Item - added</li>
			</ul>
		\`)
	});
</script>
`} />

## Attribute Directives
- `snippet`: This attribute is used to define a snippet. All elements with snippet from passed argument are synchronized with those in the page.
- `snippet-action`: This attribute tells snippets module how the snippet should be synchronized:
	- `replace`: This is going to replace the actuall snippet with a new one.
	- `append-children`: This is going to take children of a new snippet and append them on the end of the actual snippet.
	- `prepend-children`: This is going to take children of a new snippet and add them at the start of the actual snippet.

## Dispatched Events
- `snippets:redraw:start`: This event is triggered when the synchronization of created DOM from data argument starts.
- `snippets:redraw:end`: This event is triggered when the synchronization ends.
