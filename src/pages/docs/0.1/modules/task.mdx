The provided `task` function can be used to break long running task into multiple small ones which can improve INP.
The task schedules a queue of passed tasks and executes them in the order they were passed but doesn't execute them, if there is any `pending input` from the user.
It gives the task lower priority than user input so the user input is processed before the task.

Signalize use it for example to trigger DOM ready events. In future, it will be probably used on more places.

## Installation
The `tash` plugin comes with the Signalize default installation. You just need to import it.

```js
import Signalize from 'signalizejs';
import taskPlugin from 'signalizejs/task';

const { task } = new Signalize({
	plugins: [ taskPlugin() ]
});
```

## Api

### task
Call a function provided as argument only if there is no user input
```js
const { task } = signalize

let i = 100;
// Long running while
// Imagine some DOM operations
// like appending loaded products/articles
while(i--) {
	// Schedule multiple tasks
	// Execute them instantly
	// or wait on the user interaction to finish
	task(() => {
		// Do something
	})
}
```
